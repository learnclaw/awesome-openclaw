# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to **Awesome OpenClaw**.

This is a curated list — quality matters more than volume.

## What we accept

- Official docs, guides, and repositories related to OpenClaw
- High-quality tutorials, write-ups, and talks
- Ecosystem tools (skills, registries, integrations) with clear docs

## What we don’t accept

- Affiliate links, referral links, or tracking-heavy URLs
- Low-effort “AI-generated” spam posts

## How to add an item

1. Add it to the most relevant section in `README.md`.
2. Use this format:

   `- [Name](https://example.com) — short description.`

3. Keep descriptions factual and short (one sentence).
4. Avoid marketing claims (“best”, “#1”, “guaranteed”, etc.).
5. If the link is paywalled, label it (e.g. “(paywalled)”).

## Review notes

- Prefer official domains: `openclaw.ai`, `docs.openclaw.ai`, and `github.com/openclaw/openclaw`.
- If you’re unsure whether a domain is legit, open an issue first.
